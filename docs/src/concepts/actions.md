# Actions

## Overview

Actions are functions available in preset files. They are a layer of abstraction for diverse kind of manipulations, such as copies, editions, deletions, package installations, and more.

They are the key concept of Preset: easy to use, powerful enough to make almost any kind of preset.

## Usage

Actions are globally avaiable in a preset file. Typings are provided by default if you used `preset init`, so you can benefit from IDE autocompletion. Every action is a single asynchronous function call with a single object parameter. Every object parameter accepts a `title` property that changes the text displayed in the console for the corresponding action when applying the preset.

## Available actions

The following actions are implemented.
